# Moodstocks SDK - Sample apps

The Moodstocks SDK provides a scanner for mobile devices. It recognizes both barcodes and images. Scanning operates on the client-side which lets you create nice augmented reality overlays. Also it even works off-line thanks to a built-in, easy-to-use on-device image signatures synchronization.

The SDK is provided as a lightweight, embeddable and pre-built C library that comes with open source code samples written for your favorite mobile OS (iOS or Android).

To get started (for free!) create an account on https://developers.moodstocks.com/ and follow the instructions.
